# SpotifyRecommenderSystem
This code supports my master's thesis. A two-stage hybrid recommender system is constructed. The thesis studies the effect of feature engineering techniques on cluster similarity, as well as the performance on a Spotify recommender system. Data is obtained from Kaggle (Ansari, 2020) (Banerjee, 2018).
